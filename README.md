But this boy is so much like me in a many life situations, so i hope you`ll like he!

I really like to develop programs. I like to do some automations, improve efficiency of technical processes, etc. I like open source and want to improve my skills and are contribute to some unpopular projects with a good idea or just an entusiastic maintainer/maintainers.
